        - Switched to global command registration to simplify management and ensure consistency.
        - Introduced asynchronous and batch processing for command registration to reduce startup time and avoid rate limits.
        - Centralized interaction handling for better organization and ease of updates.
        - Enhanced error handling and logging for improved reliability and debugging.
        - Updated database schema and initialization to keep the application model in sync and simplify updates.
    - **Purpose**: Consolidate changes for improved bot performance and maintainability.

10. **Configurability improvements**
    - **Changes**:
        - Moved key parameters (check intervals, cooldown durations, etc.) to environment variables.
        - Implemented `init()` function to load and validate configuration on startup.
    - **Purpose**: Make the bot more flexible and easier to configure.

## Utility Commands
11. **Updated and maintained utility commands**
